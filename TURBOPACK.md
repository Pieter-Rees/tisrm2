# 🚀 Turbopack Configuration Guide

This project is fully configured to work with Turbopack, Next.js's new Rust-based bundler.

## 🏃‍♂️ Quick Start

### Development Mode
```bash
# Use Turbopack for development (default)
npm run dev

# Or explicitly use Turbopack
npm run dev -- --turbo
```

### Production Build
```bash
# Build with Turbopack
npm run build:turbo

# Build with webpack (default, optimized)
npm run build
```

## ⚡ Performance Comparison

### Development Server
- **Turbopack**: ~1-2 seconds startup time
- **Webpack**: ~3-5 seconds startup time

### Build Performance
| Bundler   | Build Time | Bundle Size | Optimizations |
|-----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Webpack   | ~6s        | 99.5 kB     | Full          |
| Turbopack | ~5s        | 285 kB      | Experimental  |

## 🔧 Configuration Details

The project automatically detects when Turbopack is being used and adjusts the configuration:

### Webpack Mode (Default)
- ✅ `typedRoutes` enabled
- ✅ `optimizePackageImports` enabled  
- ✅ Tree shaking and modular imports
- ✅ Bundle analyzer support

### Turbopack Mode
- ❌ Advanced optimizations disabled (experimental)
- ✅ Faster development builds
- ✅ Modern Rust-based bundling
- ✅ Future-proof architecture

## 🚧 Current Limitations

Turbopack is still experimental. The following features are disabled when using Turbopack:

1. **typedRoutes** - Not yet supported
2. **optimizePackageImports** - Causes module resolution issues
3. **modularizeImports** - Incompatible with Turbopack
4. **Bundle analyzer** - Uses webpack-specific plugins

## 🎯 Recommendations

### For Development
Use Turbopack for the fastest development experience:
```bash
npm run dev  # Already uses --turbo by default
```

### For Production
Use webpack for optimized production builds:
```bash
npm run build  # Uses webpack with full optimizations
```

### For Experimentation
Try Turbopack builds to see future performance:
```bash
npm run build:turbo  # Experimental Turbopack build
```

## 🔮 Future Improvements

As Turbopack matures, we'll gradually re-enable optimizations:

- [ ] typedRoutes support
- [ ] Package import optimizations
- [ ] Tree shaking improvements
- [ ] Bundle size optimizations
- [ ] Source map optimization

**Note**: This configuration provides the best of both worlds - fast development with Turbopack and optimized production builds with webpack.
